 Aircraft Engine Predictive Maintenance Analysis (CMAPSS)

 Project Overview
This project is an analysis of the CMAPSS aircraft engine dataset to understand
engine degradation and support predictive maintenance.

Main focus of the project:
- Aircraft engine dataset preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis of engine sensors
- Normalization and feature preparation
- Insights into engine performance and degradation

This project was created as a data science/machine learning portfolio
with a case study on aerospace predictive maintenance.
